        <h3>It's better to ask for permission than beg for forgiveness.</h3>
        <p>Despite Grace Hopper saying the exact opposite, when it comes to licensing, the words above are the words I live by. When I graduated college, I fell into copyright. I was hired by a major educational publisher as a temp. Lucky for me, it was love at first sight. I learned everything I could about copyright and trademark for photos and video, text, and music..</p>

        <p>I made myself an expert through experience, education, and a lot of late nights reading books, articles, and watching YouTube videos. I started with public domain, trademark, fair use and third-party rights. I moved on from there to secondary rights and layered rights, music rights, and footage rights. Then I leveled up a little further to add personality rights, due diligence, privacy rights, and freedom of panorama. I've worked on clearances for individuals and works in the United States and internationally. I've worked with almost every major educational textbook publisher and several independently published authors. I've negotiated fees, I've negotiated rights, I've negotiaged both at the same time.<br /><br /> What does that mean for you? It means that no matter your project or your budget I'm going to do my absolute best to get you the material you want on time, under budget, and with the rights you need. I'll put my experience toward your success, and I'll be upfront and honest about the process. Securing rights isn't always easy and it isn't always inexpensive, but after almost ten years working in the business, I can help you navigate any issues you might run into. And I'm going to organize your contracts, too.</p>
